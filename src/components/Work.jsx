					I worked on the www.emmasdiary.co.uk website on a daily basis. I helped migrate the old site from the TRA CMS to the 
					new Sitefinity CMS. I learned how to use Sitefinity and then taught the less technical members of staff how to use it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also made HTML emails, making sure that the emails looked consistent in: outlook gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail and that 
					they rendered consistently on different browsers. We used Lyris to deliver our emails, I learned to use the many features 
					of Lyris like uploading data, creating segments, creating conditions, producing reports when required about the open rates 
					and the click throughs. I also stuck to email best practices when sending emails.
				</p>
				<p>
					I designed banners for the site, pushing products from companies like Philips, Argos, Huggies, Palmers, etc. 
					We used 24/7 realmedia (OAS) to deliver the ads onto our site. I used OAS to make new campaign ads. 
					I added in the relevant fields like number of impressions, position, delivery rates, run of site, creatives, 
					etc and made it live and made sure that the ads were pulling through on the right pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					I made some pages that used jQuery on the site, for example quizzes and games. I have also implemented 
					“cover it live” into the site. This program lets you do a live Q&A session, I implemented it onto the site, 
					learned how to use it and trained members of staff on how to use it and third parties so they could run the 
					Q&A by themselves and only required my assistance for technical issues.
